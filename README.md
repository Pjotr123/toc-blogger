Clickable Table of Contents for a Blogger web page. This code gives you a very simple Table of Contents on a Blogger.com blog. Disadvantage: it needs some manual work to apply the code. There's no automation at all.

How-to:

In the Edit mode, switch your page to HTML view, and copy/paste the html-code at the spot where you want to see a table of contents.

Blogger.com doesn't support relative ID's. So in the code, replace 'https://www.your-very-own-website.net' by the URL of, well, your very own website.

In the code, replace 'nice-story' by the name of the web page on which you've placed the table of contents code.

In the code, replace 'First item', 'Second item' etc. by the header names of your choice.

Done. Enjoy!
